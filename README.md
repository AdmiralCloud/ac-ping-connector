# AdmiralCloud Ping Connector
The ac-ping-connector launches a simple HTTP server on a given port so uptime services can ping your service.


# Installation
```
  yarn add ac-ping-connector
```

# Usage
``````
const acpc = require('./index')
const con = acpc()
// con -> { port: 40000 }
``````
You can now send requests against the IP and port to check if the service is alive.
