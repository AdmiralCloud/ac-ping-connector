# AdmiralCloud Ping Connector
The ac-ping-connector launches a simple HTTP server on a given port so uptime services can ping your service.

# Breaking change version 1
The function still behaves the same way in terms of functionality: it starts a server and logs an error if one occurs. 

The difference is that it now allows for better error handling and can be used with async/await syntax, which can make your code more readable and easier to reason about. 

# Installation
```
  yarn add ac-ping-connector
```

# Usage
``````
const acpc = require('./index')
try {
  const con = await acpc()
  // con -> { port: 40000 }
}
catch(e) {
  // handle error
}
``````

You can now send requests against the IP and port to check if the service is alive.
